            In 2011, nestled within the heart of Massapequa, New York, on the
            vibrant Long Island in Nassau County, PayMore Stores embarked on a
            transformative journey. Our inception was not merely about business;
            it was driven by a powerful vision. We aimed to fundamentally
            reshape the landscape of the second-hand electronics market, taking
            a bold stand against the relentless tide of eWaste engulfing our
            landfills.

            Our mission was clear: to rescue discarded electronics, breathe new
            life into them, and redirect them into the market, all while
            minimizing the ever-expanding footprint of electronic waste. We set
            out to be more than just another electronics store; we envisioned
            ourselves as stewards of sustainability and innovation.

            How did we bring this vision to life? By enticing our customers to
            trade in their old electronics for cash, safeguarding their data,
            and offering unbeatable deals on refurbished electronics backed by
            warranties. The results were nothing short of remarkable. We swiftly
            began fulfilling large electronic device orders from across the
            United States and even fostered partnerships on an international
            scale.

            By 2012, our first Massapequa location had become a buzzing
            epicenter. High-volume trade-ins, savvy shoppers seeking quality
            second-hand electronics, and unwavering local support all fueled our
            momentum.

            At this juncture, PayMore Stores had become the go-to destination in
            our community—a place where people could not only safely trade in
            their old or broken electronic devices for cash but also upgrade
            their tech and shop for discounted electronics. Our dedicated staff
            provided expert guidance and support, making the experience truly
            exceptional.

          The realization dawned that our concept was not just beneficial for
          the environment but also had the potential to be replicated
          nationwide. We saw an opportunity to empower tech-savvy entrepreneurs,
          offering them the chance to own their PayMore Stores. These stores
          would serve as beacons of eco-consciousness and innovation,
          transforming the second-hand electronics market one location at a
          time.

          With a small storefront initially, our Massapequa location expanded to
          two adjacent spots to meet the growing demands of our community. Our
          dynamic buy, sell, and trade model made us Long Island’s top-grossing
          second-hand electronics dealer. We garnered over 30,000 satisfied
          customers and even earned recognition from Entrepreneur magazine,
          catapulting us into the national spotlight.
